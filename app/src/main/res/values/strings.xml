        The main page has 1 entry field which takes 1 type of search query: an Amazon Item link
        \n
        Links should be formatted such that they appear as:\n
        https://amazon.ca (com, com.uk, etc.)/dp/itemID
        \n
        For example: https://www.amazon.ca/dp/product/B07SXMZLP9\n

        Any link may be turned into this by stripping off the excess after the item ID in the URL.\n
        Upon submitting a search query, there will be an attempted connection to server to retrieve the data required.\n
        One may also access their watchlist using the action button in the bottom left corner of the page.
